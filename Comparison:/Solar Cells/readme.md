# Conclusion
Solar panels, even without heliostats, are over 12x more efficient in kwh per meter^2 than Bamboo! Even under ideal conditions: 40 ton/hectare (10k meters) of bamboo harvest or 4kg/meter^2 is only equal to 22.8 kwh/m^2/year. A 20% efficient solar cell makes 1 kwh per day or over 365 Kwh/year! This is far superior to bamboo.
